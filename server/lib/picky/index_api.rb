# This class defines the indexing and index API that is exposed to the user
# as the #index method inside the Application class.
#
# It provides a single front for both indexing and index options. We suggest to always use the index API.
#
# Note: An Index holds both an *Indexed*::*Index* and an *Indexing*::*Type*.
#
class IndexAPI
  
  attr_reader :name, :indexing, :indexed
  
  # Create a new index with a given source.
  #
  # === Parameters
  # * name: A name that will be used for the index directory and in the Picky front end.
  # * source: Where the data comes from, e.g. Sources::CSV.new(...)
  #
  # === Options
  # * result_identifier: Use if you'd like a different identifier/name in the results than the name of the index.
  # * after_indexing: As of this writing only used in the db source. Executes the given after_indexing as SQL after the indexing process.
  #
  def initialize name, source, options = {}
    @name     = name
    @indexing = Indexing::Index.new name, source, options
    @indexed  = Indexed::Index.new  name, options
    
    # Centralized registry.
    #
    Indexes.register self
  end
  
  # Defines a searchable category on the index.
  #
  # === Parameters
  # * category_name: This identifier is used in the front end, but also to categorize query text. For example, “title:hobbit” will narrow the hobbit query on categories with the identifier :title.
  #
  # === Options
  # * partial: Partial::None.new or Partial::Substring.new(from: starting_char, to: ending_char). Default is Partial::Substring.new(from: -3, to: -1).
  # * similarity: Similarity::None.new or Similarity::Phonetic.new(similar_words_searched). Default is Similarity::None.new.
  # * qualifiers: An array of qualifiers with which you can define which category you’d like to search, for example “title:hobbit” will search for hobbit in just title categories. Example: qualifiers: [:t, :titre, :title] (use it for example with multiple languages). Default is the name of the category.
  # * qualifier: Convenience options if you just need a single qualifier, see above. Example: qualifiers => :title. Default is the name of the category.
  # * source: Use a different source than the index uses. If you think you need that, there might be a better solution to your problem. Please post to the mailing list first with your application.rb :)
  # * from: Take the data from the data category with this name. Example: You have a source Sources::CSV.new(:title, file:'some_file.csv') but you want the category to be called differently. The you use from: define_category(:similar_title, :from => :title).
  #
  def define_category category_name, options = {}
    category_name = category_name.to_sym
    
    indexing_category = indexing.define_category category_name, options
    indexed_category  = indexed.define_category  category_name, options
    
    yield indexing_category, indexed_category if block_given?

  end
  alias category define_category
  
  #  HIGHLY EXPERIMENTAL Try if you feel "beta" ;)
  #
  # Make this category range searchable with a fixed range. If you need other ranges, define another category with a different range value.
  #
  # Example:
  # You have data values inside 1..100, and you want to have Picky return
  # not only the results for 47 if you search for 47, but also results for
  # 45, 46, or 47.2, 48.9, in a range of 2 around 47, so (45..49).
  #
  # Then you use:
  #  my_index.define_ranged_category :values_inside_1_100, 2
  #
  # Optionally, you give it a precision value to reduce the error margin
  # around 47 (Picky is a bit liberal).
  #  my_index.define_ranged_category :values_inside_1_100, 2, precision: 5
  #
  # This will force Picky to maximally be wrong 5% of the given range value
  # (5% of 2 = 0.1) instead of the default 20% (20% of 2 = 0.4).
  #
  # We suggest not to use much more than 5 as a higher precision is more performance intensive for less and less precision gain.
  #
  # == Protip 1
  #
  # Create two ranged categories to make an area search:
  #   index.define_ranged_category :x, 1
  #   index.define_ranged_category :y, 1
  #
  # Search for it using for example:
  #   x:133, y:120
  #
  # This will search this square area (* = 133, 120: The "search" point entered):
  # 
  #    132       134
  #     |         |
  #   --|---------|-- 121
  #     |         |
  #     |    *    |
  #     |         |
  #   --|---------|-- 119
  #     |         | 
  #
  # Note: The area does not need to be square, but can be rectangular.
  #
  # == Protip 2
  #
  # Create three ranged categories to make a volume search.
  #
  # Or go crazy and use 4 ranged categories for a space/time search! ;)
  #
  # === Parameters
  # * category_name: The category_name as used in #define_category.
  # * range: The range (in the units of your data values) around the query point where we search for results.
  #
  #  -----|<- range  ->*------------|-----
  #
  # === Options
  # * precision: Default is 1 (20% error margin, very fast), up to 5 (5% error margin, slower) makes sense.
  # * ... all options of #define_category.

  #  HIGHLY EXPERIMENTAL Not correctly working yet. Try it if you feel "beta".
  #
  # Also a range search see #define_ranged_category, but on the earth's surface.
  #
  # Parameters:
  # * name: The name as used in #define_category.
  # * radius: The distance (in km) around the query point which we search for results.
  #
  # Note: Picky uses a square, not a circle. We hope that's ok for most usages.
