    # Combinations are a number of Combination-s.
    #
    # They are the core of an allocation.
    # An allocation consists of a number of combinations.
    #
    module Combinations # :nodoc:all

      # Memory Combinations contain specific methods for
      # calculating score and ids in memory.
      #
      class Memory < Base

        # Returns the result ids for the allocation.
        #
        # Sorts the ids by size and & through them in the following order (sizes):
        # 0. [100_000, 400, 30, 2]
        # 1. [2, 30, 400, 100_000]
        # 2. (100_000 & (400 & (30 & 2))) # => result
        #
        # Note: Uses a C-optimized intersection routine (in performant.c)
        #       for speed and memory efficiency.
        #
        # Note: In the memory based version we ignore the (amount) needed hint.
        #       We cannot use the information to speed up the algorithm, unfortunately.
