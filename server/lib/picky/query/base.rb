# = Picky Queries
#
# A Picky Query is an object which:
# * holds one or more indexes
# * offers an interface to query these indexes.
#
# You connect URL paths to indexes via a Query.
#
# We recommend not to use this directly, but connect it to an URL and query through one of these
# (Protip: Use "curl 'localhost:8080/query/path?query=exampletext')" in a Terminal.
#
# There are two flavors of queries:
# * Query::Full (Full results with all infos)
# * Query::Live (Same as the Full results without result ids. Useful for query result counters.)
#
module Query
  
  # The base query class.
  #
  # Not directly instantiated. However, its methods are used by its subclasses, Full and Live.
